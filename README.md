# BAD APPLE!!
This code reads a video source, iterates through its frames and draws the frame into your terminal based on pixel colors while plays the music theme of bad apple PV!

This may take a little to start, i chose to build the frames every run instead saving a json file with binary data. But that's ok depending of video aspect ratio you've defined.

If you have any questions let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexandresenpa1).

## How can i run it?
First of all, install the requirements running on your terminal
```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    # or pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Once you've done that, open the run.py file and change `VIDEO_PATH` const if the video source its outside the root folder.

All set up, lets go!

```bash
    python3 run.py
    # or py run.py
```
